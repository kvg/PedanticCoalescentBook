Coalescent theory: a pedantic dissection
========================================

This book contains my notes on coalescent theory, sourced primarily from _Coalescent Theory: An Introduction_ and _Gene Genealogies, Variation and Evolution_. While those textbooks often expect a certain familiarity with combinatorics and statistics, this one does not. These are my notes on the subject, and I can be incredibly pedantic. Thus, youâ€™ll often find complete derivations here for things you might already know how to derive fairly easily (or might not have cared to in the first place).
